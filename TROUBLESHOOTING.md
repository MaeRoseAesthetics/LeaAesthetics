# Troubleshooting Guide - Current Issues

## Issues Identified:

### 1. API Endpoints Not Working (404 Errors)
**Problem**: All API endpoints return 404 - `/api/admin/setup`, `/api/clients/register`, `/api/students/register`

**Root Cause**: Vercel configuration was too complex and preventing API function deployment

**Solution Applied**: 
- Simplified `vercel.json` to minimal configuration
- Let Vercel auto-detect and deploy API functions
- Deployment should complete successfully now

### 2. Registration Forms - "Complete" Button Issues
**Problem**: Client and student registration forms won't allow completing registration

**Root Cause**: The registration forms are multi-step (4 steps total) and the "Complete Registration" button only appears on step 4. The API endpoints they call are not working.

**Registration Form Structure**:
- **Step 1**: Personal Information
- **Step 2**: Contact & Emergency Information  
- **Step 3**: Medical/Educational Information
- **Step 4**: Preferences & Final Details ← **Submit button is here**

**How to reach step 4**:
1. Fill out all required fields in each step
2. Click "Next Step" to progress
3. The "Complete Registration" button appears in step 4

### 3. Admin Setup Not Working
**Problem**: JSON parsing errors when trying to create admin account

**Root Cause**: Same as #1 - API endpoint `/api/admin/setup` returns 404/HTML instead of JSON

## Next Steps:

1. **Wait for deployment** (2-3 minutes after last push)
2. **Test API endpoints** - should work now with simplified config
3. **Try admin setup** at `/admin-setup` 
4. **Test registration flows** - complete all 4 steps to reach submit button

## Testing URLs:
- Admin Setup: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/admin-setup`
- Client Registration: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/client-registration`
- Student Registration: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/student-registration`
- API Test: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/test`

## Expected Results:
- ✅ API endpoints should return JSON (not 404/HTML)
- ✅ Admin setup should work without JSON parsing errors
- ✅ Registration forms should allow completion at step 4
- ✅ Static assets (JS/CSS) should load properly
